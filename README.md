Personal Financial Assistant (Budget System)
This project is a command-line financial budget system written in Python.
It was developed as part of the Software Construction course at Uganda Christian University, Mukono.
The system helps students track their daily expenses against a set budget, providing real-time feedback and a final summary report. Think of it as a digital ledger designed to reduce financial stress during campus life.
